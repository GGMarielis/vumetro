# VU Meter Project

This is a **VU Meter** project that uses LEDs to visualize audio signal levels. The project includes schematic designs, PCB layouts, and simulation files.

## Features

- **LED Display**: Shows the audio signal level in real-time.
- **Microcontroller-Based**: Uses a microcontroller for signal processing.
- **Simulation Files**: Includes Proteus 8+ simulation for testing.
- **Eagle PCB Design**: Provides board design files for fabrication.
- **Adjustable Sensitivity**: Can be calibrated for different input signals.

## How It Works

1. The audio signal is taken from an input source.
2. The signal is processed and converted into a corresponding LED display.
3. The brightness and number of LEDs represent the signal intensity.
4. Users can adjust sensitivity to optimize visualization.
